# The Who and What of PetriPod

We are a group of open source developers, looking to provide an easy way for home users and IT technicians alike to deploy their favourite services, or as we like to call them.. 'PetriPods' on their own private infrastructure.

We are currently in the development stage, focusing on the core services that will power your PetriPods, now and in the future. By basing our efforts on Rancher Labs [K3s](https://k3s.io/) Project, anyone will be able to harness the power of Kubernetes, in a user friendly way.

This is an exciting time for us. We hope to see you around the interwebs.

Again, from all of us here.. Welcome to PetriPod
